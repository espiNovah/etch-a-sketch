# Sketch Up

Creating Dynamic Elements can be fun until you get caught in the web of the bubble effect (lol)

At some point I was in that web, but now I understand more about event delegation. 

This is my version of the popular Etch A Sketch from The Odin Project.


Some stuff I did and learned

- Create dynamic HTML elements with JavaScript
- Listen to mouse event on the elements that make the grid
- Remove the grid on page when user changes grid size and recreate the grids with new value
- Use javascript to add hover effect to grid
